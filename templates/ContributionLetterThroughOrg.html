<p>Dear {contact.first_name}:</p>

<p>Thank you for your recent contribution through **organization**! Your
    generosity provides the resources necessary for our 1,700+ volunteers to build upon and maintain a
    vast network of trails in and around New York and New Jersey and to educate the public on the
    responsible use of trails and the natural environment.</p>

<p>Membership dues and the sale of Trail Conference maps, books, and other merchandise only partially
    fund our work. We also rely on donations such as yours and those made by local businesses,
    corporations, foundations, and our program partners.</p>

<p>As you hike this magnificent region, you can proudly say that you are helping to keep it green, and that
    you are part of the team that has built and continues to maintain over 2,100 miles of trails. Your
    donation helps us invest in our people and services that preserve and enhance our natural
    environment.</p>

<p>With sincere thanks,</p>

<p>{contribution.electronic_signature}</p>
<p>Edward K. Goodell<br/>
    Executive Director</p>

<p>P.S. Keep your eye on our website for information about upcoming events, workshops,
    and other trail related news!</p>
